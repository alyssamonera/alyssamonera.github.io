        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Inspired by the popular bookstore trend (and by a hereby unnamed dating application), this app aims to provide users with the opportunity to find and browse books by description. Discover new books! Discover old books! Do that thing like in the Pina Colada song where the guy ends up leaving his girlfriend for his own girlfriend through an anonymous paper ad, but with books! Do YOU like pina coladas or getting caught in the rain?! Find a book that likes that, too!</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Select a genre.</li>
          <li>Set how many matches you want to get out of a single round. The rounds currently aren't infinite, so you will get back a results page once you've reached your specified quota. Please try to keep it below 40!</li>
          <li>Specify an age limit. This will determine the publish date range for the books that display on the swipe page.</li>
          <li>On the app page, press the left button to dismiss a match and the right button to add it to your match history.</li>
          <li>Once you've matched with the right amount of books, you'll be taken to the results page to see the results of your most recent round of swipes.</li>
          <li>You can also navigate to the match history tab at any time to view all your matches in one place.</li>
        <h3>Important Notice</h3>
        <p>As this app is currently in development, the site as it is now exists purely for demo purposes. As such, you will need an API key from Google Books in order to play this game.</p>
        <p><a href="https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started">You can follow the instructions here to obtain your own API key.</a></p>
